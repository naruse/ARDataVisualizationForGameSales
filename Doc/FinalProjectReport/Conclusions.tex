\section{Conclusions}
I have exposed 6 consoles with 31 platforms some of them are still present,
some of them didnt even make it outside of their country. With the
aid of the Augmented Reality application, the user would have hopefully
understood better the data contained in the dataset.\\

No dataset is fully complete and unfortunately this dataset was not the
exception; there are interesting visualizations that could have been
implemented if the \texttt{Critic\_score, Critic\_count, User\_score} and
\texttt{User\_count} fields where complete.\\

Performance is critical when developing mobile apps and one has to put more
attention to detail when working with Augmented Reality in mobile devices as
processing time not only has to be spent rendering images but also doing
image processing to recognize image targets where the processed data is going
to be anchored.\\

Comparsions are possible to be made just by dragging another image target to
draw another UI to the right representing the console; unfortunately the
comparsions that can be made are limited just to sales as the years of each
platform differ vastly.
