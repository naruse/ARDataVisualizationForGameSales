\section{Conclusions}
There are some things that are missing from the executive summary due to the
complexity and extension of this topic, still this executive summary serves
as a general guide and starting point of what should be done in order to
cover the 20 critical infrastructure categories.\\

No approach or technique is 100\% robust against attacks, we have layed down a
set of categories that tackle the most critical parts of a security
infrastructure nowadays. Even though is not possible to assure with full
certainity that these suggestions are bullet proof, these propposals serve
as starting point on protecting the enterprise. These recommendations should not be
taken as final and in case the requirements of the enterprise need changes
they should be adjusted accordingly.\\

The role of the Chief Information Security Officer and his team are critical
in any company nowadays. No enterprise small or big is safe to today's
attacks but with a good privacy policy plans is possible to be prepared
to today's attacks to the Information Technology infrastructure.\\

Ongoing training and awareness of the security controls in any company is
critical to all employees as security risks are not only in hardware or software
but also on the employees themselves.
