\subsection*{Introduction} % (fold)
This project report contains information and knowledge of a dataset for
video game sales ranging from the early 80's to 2016. The idea of this report
itself is to also serve as a platform to visualize through augmented reality
the data contained in the report.\\

This report was developed in conjuntion with a mobile app called
ARMeet; \textit{ARMeet} is an app used to easily visualize information
contained in reports shared in meetings, ARMeet lets the user compare
visualizations just by placing an extra label next to each image at the end
of each chapter.\\

ARMeet was build because it's critical for everyone in a meeting to understand what a report
contains. And the faster this task is achieved the better as users are able
to make questions about the data contained in the report instead taking the
time to understand the data itself in the meeting.\\

With the help of Augmented Reality, ARMeet aims to ease the understandment of
the data contained in the report and to some extent, it will let the users
compare information in it. The knowledge in the report pages is able to be
visualized through a smart phone using the report pages themselves as anchor
points to draw the data it contains.\\

In this report we are going to visualize a dataset called Video Game Sales from
\textit{Kaggle}\cite{KaggleDataset}. This dataset contains sales from 1980
throughout 2016 from different video game consoles and their respective
platforms. Each game contains sales disected from US, Europe, Japan and other
countries.\\

This project is built in Vuforia\cite{Vuforia} which takes care of the Augmented Reality part in
conjunction with Unity3D\cite{Unity3D} for the rendering side.
